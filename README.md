# AWS Labs — Practical Hands-On Repository

Welcome to **AWS Labs**, a curated collection of hands-on exercises and problem-solving guides designed to strengthen your understanding of **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.  
This repository serves as a personal knowledge base for performing, documenting, and mastering AWS service configurations through real-world scenarios.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a **practical foundation** in AWS by completing focused lab exercises.
- Document each lab’s **problem statement**, **step-by-step solution**, and **explanation**.
- Provide reusable **policy JSONs**, **CLI commands**, and **architectural patterns** for future reference.
- Serve as a **personal AWS portfolio** to showcase understanding of cloud administration, DevOps, and architecture principles.

## 📚 Module Overview

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides:
- **Compute** (EC2, Lambda, ECS, EKS)
- **Storage** (S3, EBS, Glacier)
- **Networking** (VPC, CloudFront, Route 53)
- **Security** (IAM, KMS, Cognito)
- **Databases** (RDS, DynamoDB)
- **Monitoring & Management** (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFormation)

Each module or service in this repository focuses on a core AWS domain.  
For every topic, a separate **lab directory** includes:
- A detailed **README.md** explaining the concept.
- **Problem statements** that simulate real industry scenarios.
- **Step-by-step implementation guides** using both **AWS Console** and **AWS CLI**.
- **JSON templates**, **CLI snippets**, and optional **infrastructure-as-code** references (CloudFormation/Terraform).

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By completing all labs in this module, you will be able to:

1. **Understand AWS fundamentals** — IAM, EC2, S3, VPC, CloudWatch, Lambda, and more.  
2. **Implement least-privilege access models** with IAM users, groups, roles, and policies.  
3. **Launch and manage compute resources** such as EC2 instances securely.  
4. **Design scalable storage and networking solutions** using AWS-native tools.  
5. **Automate infrastructure** using AWS CLI, CloudFormation, and Terraform.  
6. **Monitor, secure, and audit** your cloud environment effectively.
